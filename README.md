# vi-project
Mini-project for the Visualization Information course (University of Aveiro)

## Data

- [Bike Share on the San Francisco Bay Area](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share) dataset
- [San Francisco Bay Area GeoJSON](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Bay-Area-Counties/s9wg-vcph)

The GeoJSON data of most cities was built by hand.

## Preprocess

In order to perform data preprocessing, download the dataset and put it in the `data` folder.
Then, run the Python scripts in the `scripts`.
The scripts should be run at the root of the project.

Note: the `status.csv` file should be split into several parts in a `status` folder inside `data`.
It's assumed the `split` command is used.

## Running

In order to run the project, simply start the `index.html` file in a live server.
